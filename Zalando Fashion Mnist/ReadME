This is my first ML project ever, in which I address the image classification problem proposed by the Zalando Fashion Mnist dataset.
This project considers only the most basic ML algorithms, without resorting to convolutional NNs and more advanced DL techniques.
The goal is to find a classification algorithm that can achieve a reasonable level of accuracy.
In our case, using the Support Vector Machine (after dimensionality reduction by PCA) we were able to achieve an accuracy of 99.88% on the training set, 
89.96% on the validation set and 89.57% on the test set.
We also experimented with different algorithms such as: Decision Tree, Random Forests, k-Nearest-Neighbours, Multinomial Logistic Regression and MLP, 
but none of these performed as good as SVM on the test set.
It was definitely not the most fun project I worked on, but it was interesting nonenthless.
