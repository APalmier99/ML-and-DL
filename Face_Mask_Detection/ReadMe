This project was part of the Statistical Methods for High Dimensional Data course, where we explored various strategies to handle high-dimensional data and address challenges related to the Curse of Dimensionality and Concentration of Measures.
Topics covered included Lasso Regularization and its variants (Elastic-net, Group Lasso, Fused Lasso, Generalized Lasso), Splines, Generalized Additive Models, and Statistical Graph Analysis.
For our project, we focused on a binary image classification problem: determining whether the subject in a photo is wearing a face mask or not. Our challenge was to address this classification task using only regularized linear models, without resorting to convolutional neural networks.
To approach the problem, we tested some linear models with different Lasso regularization techniques. We also explored the use of fused lasso as a method to denoise the images, comparing the results with PCA and Sparse PCA approaches.
With classic Lasso regularization, we aimed to identify the individual pixels that had the most significant influence on the classification outcome. Additionally, we used Group Lasso to distinguish larger groups of pixels (image regions) that were most relevant for classification purposes.
These regularization techniques were applied to Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine models, enabling us to explore their effectiveness in tackling the image classification task.
As expected, the results obtained from regularized linear models are not directly comparable to those achieved by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are renowned for their excellence in image classification tasks. Despite this, our exploration yielded valuable insights into the power and versatility of Lasso regularization techniques.
