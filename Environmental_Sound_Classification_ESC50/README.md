Final project for the Human Data Analytics course, which extensively covered advanced DL techniques including Self-Organizing Maps, Growing Neural Gas Networks, Residual Networks, Inception Networks, and more. This project focuses on Environmental Sound Classification using the ESC-50 dataset. We implemented various CNN/CRNN architectures to process both raw audio waveforms and extracted features such as MFCC and Mel-bands. The architectures were further enhanced with attention mechanisms and combined into a final ensemble. For a comprehensive understanding, I recommend you read the report before reviewing the code.
