Final project for the Human Data Analytics course.
The course delved deep into advanced DL techniques such as: Self Organizing Maps, Growing Neural Gas Networks, Residual Networks, Inception Networks and so on.
In this project we focus on Environmental Sound Classification on the ESC-50 dataset.
We implement several CNN/CRNN architectures, to deal both with the raw audio waverforms and Mel extracted features (MFCC, Mel-bands etc.).
The implemented architectures are enhanced with attention mechanisms and later combined into a final ensemble.
For a much clearer understanding, I advice you read the report first, before start looking at the code.
