This folder contains a revised version of my assignments from the Deep Learning course.
I decided to upload them here because they cover most of the topics covered in the course, 
so they might prove very useful for quickly reviewing something.
As such, I have modified the original assignments by adding more elements and sometimes even detailed theoretical explanations.
I hope they prove as useful for you as they were for me!
