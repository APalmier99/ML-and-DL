Phones Prices Analysis is the final project of my statistical learning course, carried out in collaboration with two of my colleagues.
As the title suggests, we conducted a statistical analysis of a set of phone prices in order to predict the best price range for a new phone.
Since there are 4 different price ranges, we are dealing with a multiclass classification problem.
The project is written completely in R, using RStudio, and the report is produced using R Markdown.
The complete code can be found in the .txt file. The two pdf files, on the other hand, refer to the report and the presentation slides.
As you will see from the report, the project is structured mainly in 3 parts:
- first we preprocess and clean the data;
- then we perform a statistical analysis trying to infer interesting relationships among the predictors;
- finally we implement various ML algorithms, also considering some greedy feature selection techniques based on statistical inference.
It was certainly interesting to work on and I hope you will find it equally interesting to read!
